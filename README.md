## Hi there 👋, I'm Junyi Miao (I go by Alexa).

I work at the intersection of **Environmental Data Science**, **GeoAI**, and **Climate Analytics**,  
building data-driven tools to understand **natural hazards**, **urban climate risk**, and **environmental equity**.

My work focuses on applying **remote sensing**, **machine learning**, and **geospatial analysis**  
to support **community resilience**, **sustainable cities**, and **equitable climate adaptation**.

---

## 🌍 Research & Project Focus

I organize my work around three connected themes:

### 🌋 Disaster GeoAI  
AI + remote sensing for disaster prediction, monitoring, and risk mapping  
→ wildfire, flood, earthquake, drought analytics  

🔗 **Repository:** `disaster-geoai`

---

### 🏙️ Urban Resilience AI  
Geospatial and machine learning models for urban heat, infrastructure vulnerability,  
and climate-resilient city systems  

🔗 **Repository:** `urban-resilience-ai`

---

### ⚖️ Equity & Environmental Analytics  
Quantifying environmental exposure disparities and climate burdens  
across income and demographic groups  

🔗 **Repository:** `equity-environment`

---

## 🧰 Skills & Tools

- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn), SQL  
- **Geospatial:** GeoPandas, Rasterio, GDAL, OSMnx  
- **Machine Learning:** tree-based models, spatial regression, baseline deep learning  
- **Data Sources:** Remote sensing (Sentinel, Landsat), Census / ACS, EPA datasets  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Folium, Kepler.gl, Tableau  
- **Workflow:** reproducible notebooks, ETL pipelines, research-oriented GitHub repos  

---

## 🎯 Current Goal

Build a cohesive, open-source portfolio demonstrating how **GeoAI and environmental data science**  
can support **disaster risk reduction**, **urban climate resilience**, and **environmental justice**.
